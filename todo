constraint from exctintion does not seem to have effect. (Related to dilution factor?)
Does it make sense to do two strategies? What matters is just maximizing size... 
If including extinction as fatal event, bet-hedging would be more important.

Makes sense that it is either/or?
Spontaneous persistence only optimal if nutrients and antibiotics are decoupled, because then there is a benefit from waking up early, and the benefit increases the earlier the wake up.

Why is spontaneous persistence only optimal when decoupled? Because otherwise missing out on too much later growth, i.e. better to wake up late than go to sleep again.

Stochastic T0 would maybe allow both strategies at same time?
integrate fitness over T0

For T0 \approx 0:
spontaneous persistence can never be optimal because finite delta affect the growth even long after ab is gone.

T0 >> 0:
triggered persistence can not be optimal because having long enough triggered persistence to help againt ab would mean
loosing out on growth before ab.

When T0 > 0, but not very large:
If p is frequent, better to sleep longer?
ig p in not frequent/T short



# Mutation simulation
- verify case without Mutation, need to run ~10_000
  Run 10_000 steps of:
    - T0=0, Tab=12
    - T0=2, Tab=10/12
    - T0=larger?
- add mutation
- check initialisations (max and optimal)
